ManuMaster dal 1985 - Web demo

Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- game.js

How to run locally:
- Open index.html in a browser (desktop or mobile). On iPad/Safari you can "Add to Home Screen" for a fullscreen feel.

How to publish:
1) itch.io (recommended for HTML5 games)
   - On iPad: go to itch.io, log in and create a new project/game.
   - Choose "Upload files" and upload a ZIP containing the files above.
   - In the game settings set "Kind of project" -> HTML and set the width/height to 960x540.
   - Publish the page. itch.io gives you a shareable link.

2) GitHub Pages
   - Create a new GitHub repo and push these files to the repository root (branch main).
   - In repo Settings → Pages → choose branch 'main' / folder 'root' then Save.
   - After a minute the site will be live at https://<username>.github.io/<repo>.

If you want, posso also provide:
- a ready-to-copy ZIP structure (I can create it when the file tooling is available),
- step-by-step screenshots (for each step on itch.io or Working Copy on iPad),
- a GitHub Actions workflow to auto-deploy to GitHub Pages.
